##  Motive <a name = "motive"></a>

Welcome to my coding practice repository! This repository is a collection of various data structure and algorithm implementations in C++, including arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, binary search, and more. It serves as a resource for practicing coding problems and understanding fundamental concepts in computer science.

##  Contents <a name = "contents"></a>

The repository contains:

- **Arrays**: Implementations and solutions related to array manipulation, searching, sorting, and other array-related problems.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and solutions to linked list problems.
- **Trees**: Binary tree and binary search tree implementations, as well as solutions to tree-related problems like traversals, insertion, deletion, and more.
- **Stacks**: Implementations of stack data structure and solutions to stack-related problems.
- **Queues**: Implementations of queue data structure and solutions to queue-related problems.
- **Binary Search**: Implementation of binary search algorithm and solutions to binary search problems.
